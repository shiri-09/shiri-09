# Hi, I'm Sriraksha 👋

**First-year B.Tech student at PES University** focused on building real-world systems at the intersection of **AI, backend engineering, and security**.

I learn by building — from real-time communication systems to intelligent monitoring pipelines. Currently exploring how AI can solve practical problems in areas like drone security, intrusion detection, and autonomous systems.

## Featured Project

### 🛡️ DroneGuard-AI
**Real-time drone intrusion detection and failsafe system**

A security-focused monitoring system that detects anomalies in drone behavior and automatically triggers protective mechanisms.

**What it does:**
- Monitors live telemetry streams (GPS, IMU, speed, heading)
- Detects GPS spoofing, sensor inconsistencies, and abnormal flight patterns
- Triggers automated failsafe responses when threats are identified
- Provides a real-time dashboard for live monitoring and alerts

**Built with:**
`FastAPI` · `WebSockets` · `Raspberry Pi` · `Python` · `Real-time Dashboard`

> Designed to address real security concerns in autonomous drone operations.

## Current Goals

- 📚 Deepening my understanding of **distributed systems** and **system design**
- 🤖 Exploring **edge AI** and on-device inference for embedded systems
- 🔐 Learning more about **offensive security** and vulnerability research
- 🚀 Building projects that solve tangible problems, not just demos
