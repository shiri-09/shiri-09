# Hi, I'm Sriraksha 👋

I’m a **first-year B.Tech student at PES University** with a passion for building real-world systems using AI, backend engineering, and real-time communication. I focus on hands-on projects that solve practical problems—from drone security to embedded networking and intelligent vision.

## 🚀 What I Build

I learn by doing: designing, coding, debugging, and iterating systems that work in the real world. My projects span **security-aware frameworks**, **real-time services**, and **AI-powered perception**.
